# Open microfluidic infrastructure
This repo is made for open-source microfluidic infrastructure designs made by the TalTech LoC team. We share 3D printable designs. Files are in STL format, which you can slice for your printer of choice. There are two types of designs, you will see one or both of these tags in the design subfolder's name: 
- FDM: these designs (or parts marked as "FDM" in the design) are for FDM printers, such as the [Original Prusa i3 MK3S](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit.html) we use. 
- SLA/DLP: an SLA or DLP printer is needed for these designs. We use an [AnyCubic Photon Mono](https://www.anycubic.com/products/photon-mono-resin-3d-printer).

You will find additional instructions (if and where necessary) in the design subfolders.
