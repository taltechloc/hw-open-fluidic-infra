This folder will contain converter and connector designs for microfluidics. We work with two connector formats: 
- 10-32 HLPC threaded fittings - these connectors can accept 10-32" flangeless fittings that are typically used with 1/16" PTFE tubing, e.g. https://www.coleparmer.de/p/idex-flangeless-standard-knurl-fitting-assemblies-10-32-flat-bottom-connection-for-1-16-od-tubing/72845
- mini-Luer ports - we usually use these connectors with transparent silicone tubing (ID: 1mm, OD: 3mm)
