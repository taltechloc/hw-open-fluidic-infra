## Chip holder (20 mm x 30 mm chip format)

Due to the small size, it is best to 3D print the chip holder parts with SLA, such as with an Anycubic Photon. 
However, with a good FDM printer such as a Prusa i3 MK3S, it may also be possible to print with good result. Make sure to support the bottom side.
